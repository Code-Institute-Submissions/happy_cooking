# Welcome to The Happy Cooking recipe webpage.

This project is a website that has been created with different food recipes such as breakfast, lunch and dessert.
I have created a multi-page website with a recipes page .
My primary target is to be able to view recipes with ingredients  on avaliablity of recipes.

#  UX 

This is a data-driven web application created for users, my primary target is to achieve the goal of being able view recipes with ingredients  on avaliablity of recipes. this is shown in the recipes page.

My data-driven web application will be a online cookbook created with  a homepage, a recipes page, my recipes page, and a login form. These pages will allow me to achieve my goals.

⋅⋅* As a user type, I would like to create a recipe page to view recipes.
⋅⋅* As a user type, I would like to create a add recipes page to add a recipe.
⋅⋅* As a user type, I would like to achieve a goal of deleting and updating a recipe by editing it.
⋅⋅* As a user type, I would like to be able to login as a user.
⋅⋅* My goal was to make information accessible on the site and user friendly, as shown through the  data-driven web application  I have created.


# Features of my data-driven web application

### Header 

The site name is shown up on the left hand corner of the page whic is the logo that brings you to the home page.

The home,recipes,my recipes and login are up on the right hand side of the navbar.These are the buttond that will link you too 
those pages.

### Footer

footer is at the bottom in home page and add recipes page.

### Index

This is the home page with the navbar link buttons and footer displayed on this page with a button linking to the recipes page.


### Recipes

This is the page where the user  can view recipes which includes a  name, image of the recipe, ingredients, instructions, serves and cooking time. if you click on the recipe image you can see the recipe as a single recipe in full.
Here you can edit which updated the recipe and delete a recipe also which deleted the recipe off the database completely.

### User Login

A user can login using the username which is "proxie" and  password which is "password" to be able to login. This username will be used to log in and add, edit and delete a recipe.

### Wire frames I designed 


Here I have included wire frames of diffrent pages such as the home page, recipe page, add recipe page, and login.

My design process for me was to draw my wireframes and add them to my project once i had figured out what I needed to create 
an acheviable site.

wire frame 1 - homepage
wireframe 2 - recipe page
wireframe3 -  add recipes page
wireframe 4 - login 

### Planning  my website

I decided to plan my website, I looked at google.com at images of diffrent websites that came up in google images that I thought would help me and give me an idea of a layout of what should be included in my page for design of the navbar, the flow of my page and the pages I would include that would tie in my website together

I understood the base of my data-driven web application should include a hmoe page to start with and then a recipes page to view recipes, another page was my recipes and the login function for a user to login.

I decided that I would draw my wire frames with a pen and paper for each of my pages.

I researched diffrent pop colours such as light blue, baby pink and background images from google i could use as a background to home, recipes page, my recipes page.

Most web applicationa are well structured but simple to use as I wanted mine to be user friendly.
